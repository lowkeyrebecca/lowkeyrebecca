hi

if you're like a friend or something please just call me rebecca or becky don't call me audrey fuck off unless you're super close

a bit weird to source people

using the lesbian title but honestly i'm so lost

i love using names like sweetie darling honey slash platonically tell me if it bothers you

the ^_^ face brings me joy

i love the words yeyy and awawawa if i'm comfy with you i'll use them

if you feel like i'm saying something that sounds slash un platonic then just hmu please tell me

bye
